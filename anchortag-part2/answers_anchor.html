           <h3>Answer 1</h3>
           <p>Mount Everest is a peak in the Himalaya mountain range. It is located between Nepal and Tibet, an autonomous region of China. At 8,849 meters (29,032 feet), it is considered the tallest point on Earth. In the nineteenth century, the mountain was named after George Everest, a former Surveyor General of India. The Tibetan name is Chomolungma, which means “Mother Goddess of the World.” The Nepali name is Sagarmatha, which has various meanings</p><br><a href="questions_anchor.html#Go back to questions">Go back to questions</a><br>

        <h3>Answer 2</h3>
        <p>
            Mount Everest [a] is the highest mountain on Earth. Mount Everest is located in the 
            Himalayas, a tall mountain range in Asia. It is about 8,848 metres (29,029 feet) high.[5]
            Mount Everest is on the line between two countries: Nepal and China. The top of the 
            mountain is in the "death zone" where the air is too thin for a human to live. People 
            need large bottles of oxygen to let them breathe. The first people to get to the top were 
            Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay in 1953. There are 18 ways (paths or routes) to get
            to the top,[6] but most people use only two ways.

        <h3>Answer 3</h3>
        <p>
            Mount Everest is located on the border between Tibet and Nepal in the Himalayas in Asia.
            Everest is situated in the Mahalangur Range on the Tibetan Plateau known as Qing Zang Gaoyuan. The summit is directly between Tibet and Nepal.
            Mount Everest keeps some tall company. The Mahalangur Range is home to four of the earth's six highest peaks. Mount Everest kind of looms in the background. First-timers to Nepal often aren't really sure which mountain is Everest until someone clarifies for them!
            On the Nepali side, Mount Everest is located in the Sagarmatha National Park in the Solukhumbu District. On the Tibetan side, Mount Everest is located in Tingri County in the Xigaze area, what China considers to be an autonomous region and part of the People's Republic of China.

        <h3>Answer4</h3>
        <p>
            The survey accepted by Nepal and China (for now) yielded: 29,029 feet (8,840 meters) above sea level.
            As technology improves, different surveying techniques keep producing different results for the literal height of Mount Everest. Geologists disagree whether measurements should be based on permanent snow or rock. Adding to their stress, tectonic movement is making the mountain grow a little each year!
            At 29,029 feet (8,840 meters) above sea level, Mount Everest is the highest and most prominent mountain on earth based on measurement to sea level.
            Asia's Himalayas—the tallest mountain range in the world—span across six countries: China, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bhutan, and Afghanistan. Himalaya means "abode of snow" in Sanskrit.</p><br><a href="questions_anchor.html#Go back to questions">Go back to questions</a><br>

        <h3>Answer5</h3>
        <p>
            Sir Edmund Hillary, a beekeeper from New Zealand and his Nepalese Sherpa, Tenzing Norgay, were the first to reach the summit on May 29, 1953, at around 11:30 a.m. The duo reportedly buried some candies and a small cross before immediately descending to celebrate becoming a part of history.
            At the time, Tibet was closed to foreigners because of the conflict with China. Nepal allowed only one Everest expedition per year; previous expeditions had come very close but failed to reach the summit.
            Controversy and theories still rage about whether or not British mountaineer George Mallory reached the summit in 1924 before perishing on the mountain. His body wasn't found until 1999. Everest is very good at generating controversies and conspiracies.

            The permit from the Nepalese government costs US $11,000 per climber. That's an expensive piece of paper. But the other not-so-little fees and charges stack onto that quickly.
            You'll be charged per day at base camp to have rescue on hand, insurance to get your body extracted if necessary...the fees can quickly climb to $25,000 before you even buy the first piece of equipment or hire Sherpas and a guide.
            The "Ice Doctor" Sherpas who prepare the season's route want compensation. You'll also be paying daily fees for cooks, phone access, garbage removal, weather forecasts, etc.—you could be at Base Camp for up to two months or more, depending on how long you acclimate.
            Gear that can withstand the hell doled out on an Everest expedition isn't cheap. A single supplemental 3-liter oxygen bottle can cost more than $500 each. You'll need at least five, maybe more. You'll have to buy for the Sherpas, too. Properly rated boots and climbing suit will both cost at least $1,000. Choosing cheap stuff could cost you toes. Personal gear usually runs between $7,000-10,000 per expedition.
            According to writer, speaker, and Seven-Summit climber Alan Arnette, the average price to reach the summit of Everest from the south with a Western guide was $66,000 in 2019.
            In 1996, Jon Krakauer's team paid $65,000 each for their summit bids. If you really want to increase your chances of reaching the top and staying alive to tell about it, you'll want to hire David Hahn. With 15 successful summit attempts, he holds the record for a non-Sherpa climber. Tagging along with him will cost you over $115,000.
