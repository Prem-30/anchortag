           <p>Money is any item or medium of exchange that is accepted by people 
             for the payment of goods and services, as well as the repayment of loans. 
             Money makes the world go 'round. Economies rely on money to facilitate 
             transactions and to power financial growth. Typically, it is economists 
             who define money, where it comes from, and what it's worth. 
             Here are the multifaceted characteristics of money.Money is a commodity 
             accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange. It is the medium
             in which prices and values are expressed. It circulates from person to person
              and country to country, facilitating trade, and it is the principal measure 
              of wealth.</p><br><a href="#Go back to questions">Go back to questions</a><br>

             Paper currency first developed in Tang dynasty China during the 7th 
             century, where it was called "'flying money'", although true paper money did 
             not appear until the 11th century, during the Song dynasty. The use of paper 
             currency later spread throughout the Mongol Empire or Yuan dynasty China.
             Jiaozi (Chinese: 交子) was a form of promissory note which appeared around the
             11th century in the Sichuan capital of Chengdu, China. Numismatists regard it
             as the first paper money in history, a development of the Chinese Song Dynasty (960–1279 CE).

             The use of metal for money can be traced back to Babylon, prior to 2000 BCE.
             Standardization and certification in the form of coinage did not occur except
             perhaps in isolated instances until the 7th century BCE.Historians generally
             ascribe the first use of coined money to Croesus, king of Lydia, a state in Anatolia.
             The Coinage of India began anywhere between early 1st millennium BCE to the 6th 
             century BCE, and consisted mainly of copper and silver coins in its initial stage. 
             The coins of this period were Karshapanas or Pana.

            How did barter system started?
             The history of bartering dates back to 6000 BC. Introduced by Mesopotamia tribes,
             bartering was adopted by the Phoenicians. The Phoenicians bartered goods to those
             located in various other cities across oceans.A barter system is an old method
             of exchange. This system has been used for centuries and long before money was
             invented. People exchanged services and goods for other services and goods in return.
             In history, coins, paper money or any other medium of exchange were not available.
             Yet trading was done with the help of precious metals such as gold, silver, copper etc.
             But those metals were not in abundance so animals were used. Moreover, goods are 
             also exchanged with one another.</p><br><a href="#Go back to questions">Go back to questions</a><br>

        <p>
             In barter system, after the economic reforms or in the developmental phase , 
             the need or requirement of a medium of exchange arise as the demand of goods
             and services were increasing due to which barter was not made perfectly. 
             For this reason, coins and paper money was invented which replaced the barter system.
             For example, a farmer may exchange a bushel of wheat for a pair of shoes from a shoemaker.
              However, these arrangements take time. If you exchange an axe as part of an agreement in 
              which the other party is supposed to kill a woolly mammoth, you have to find someone who 
              thinks the tool is a fair trade for having to face down the 12-foot tusks of a mammoth. 
              If this doesn't work, you would have to alter the deal until someone agreed to the terms.
              A type of currency slowly developed over the centuries that involved easily traded items 
              like animal skins, salt, and weapons.

           In english, the word bank means 'heap' or 'mass'. In sanskrit, the word akin to bank 
           'bhanda'. The english word bank originated from the Italian word 'banca' or from the French 
           word 'banque'. Both these words meant 'bench' for money exchange. In olden days, European money
           lenders or money changers used to display coins of different countries in big heaps on benches
           or tables for the purpose of lending or exchanging. Thus, they were exchangers of various coins.
           Thus the word bank came into use.
           A bank is that institution authorised to collect peoples savings/deposits with the purpose of 
           lending those; under the condition of returning the same when the depositor demands.
